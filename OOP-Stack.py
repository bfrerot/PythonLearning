########## OOP - STACK ##########


# A stack is a structure developed to store data in a very specific way.
# The alternative name for a stack (but only in IT terminology) is LIFO = Last In First Out
# A stack is an object with two elementary operations, conventionally named push (when a new element is put on the top) and pop (when an existing element is taken away from the top)


## PROCEDURAL approach

# 1- decide how to store the values which will arrive onto the stack
#       a list [] is the best option
stack = []
# 2- define a function that puts a value onto the stack
def push(val):
    stack.append(val)
# 3- define a unction to take a value off the stack
def pop():
    val = stack[-1]
    del stack[-1]
    return val
# to summarize:
stack = []

def push(val):
    stack.append(val)

def pop():
    val = stack[-1]
    del stack[-1]
    return val

push(3) # stack = [3]
push(2) # stack = [3,2]
push(1) # stack = [3,2,1]

print(pop())

print(pop())

print(pop())

## OBJECT approach

# how the object stack begins,  class [name]:

# we have to install a list inside each object of the class
# we want the list to be hidden from the class users' sight
# we have to add a specific statement or instruction
# The properties have to be added to the class manually
# we will equip the class with a specific function â€“ its specificity is dual:
#   it has to be named in a strict way
#   it is invoked implicitly, when the new object is created
# Such a function is called a constructor, as its general purpose is to construct a new object
# The constructor should know everything about the object's structure, 
#   and must perform all the needed initializations.

class Stack:
    def __init__ (self):
        print("Hi!")
 
stack_object = Stack()
# Hi!

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = [1,2]

stack_object = Stack()
print(len(stack_object.name))
2
# we've used dot notation, just like when invoking methods; this is the general convention
# for accessing an object's properties
# we need to name the object, put a dot (.) after it, and specify the desired property's name
# we don't use parentheses! we do not invoke a method but a property;

# Here, both functions have a parameter named "self" at the first position of the parameters list
# it is NEEDED
# All methods have to have this parameter. It plays the same role as the first constructor parameter
# It allows the method to access entities (properties and activities/methods) carried out by the actual object
# Every time Python invokes a method, it implicitly sends the current object as the first argument
# This means that a method must have at least one parameter, which is used by Python itself 

# two stacks created from the same base class
