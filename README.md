I made this repository to summarize all detailed knowledge about Python3 in order to gain PCEP,PCAP and PCPP1 certifications.
The certification is not the goal, but is a way to learn and obtain it means you understand your subject.
I used the free Network Academy courses and I can argue that I learned Python on my own, for free, with, sometimes, the precious help of chatGPT.
AI is a massive improvement in education, 200%.

Feel free to pull these notes, I will continue to update, as longas I can.
